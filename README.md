About Dataset- 
Context
While many public datasets (on Kaggle and the like) provide Apple App Store data, there are not many counterpart datasets available for Google Play Store apps anywhere on the web. On digging deeper, I found out that the iTunes App Store page deploys a nicely indexed appendix-like structure to allow for simple and easy web scraping. On the other hand, Google Play Store uses sophisticated modern-day techniques (like dynamic page load) using JQuery making scraping more challenging.

Content
Each app (row) has values for category, rating, size, and more.

Acknowledgements
This information is scraped from the Google Play Store. This app information would not be available without it.
Inspiration
The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market!

Android is the dominant mobile operating system today with about 85% of all mobile devices running Google’s OS. The Google Play Store is the largest and most popular Android app store. The purpose of our project was to gather and analyze detailed information on apps in the Google Play Store in order to provide insights on app features and the current state of the Android app market. The Play Store apps data has enormous potential to drive app-making businesses to success. Actionable insights can be drawn for developers to work on and capture the Android market. Each app (row) has values for category, rating, size, and more. Another dataset contains customer reviews of the android apps. Explore and analyze the data to discover key factors responsible for app engagement and success.

Project Name - Play Store App Reviews Analysis

Project Summary
This project focuses on gathering and analyzing comprehensive information about apps on the Google Play Store to provide valuable insights into app features and trends in the Android app market.
We utilized Python libraries such as Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib, and Seaborn to perform data cleaning, analysis, and visualization effectively.
The Google Play Store sees the addition of thousands of new applications daily, created by developers worldwide striving to make their apps successful. Given the intense global competition, it is crucial for developers to understand whether their strategies align with user preferences and market trends. While most Play Store apps are free, the revenue mechanisms—such as in-app purchases, advertisements, and subscriptions—are often ambiguous and not easily measurable. Therefore, the success of an app is usually judged by factors like the number of installations and user ratings rather than direct revenue generation.
The objective of this project is to uncover patterns and insights that help developers better understand user demands and optimize their apps for popularity and success. Specifically, we explored relationships between various attributes, such as app pricing models (free vs. paid), user reviews, and app ratings, to provide actionable insights for developers.

Problem Statement :
The goal of this project is to explore and analyze data to identify the key factors that drive app engagement and success.
The analysis is based on two datasets: one containing fundamental information about apps (googleplaystore.csv) and another with user reviews (googleplaystore_user_reviews.csv) for those apps. By thoroughly examining and evaluating these datasets, the objective is to pinpoint the critical characteristics and trends that influence user engagement and contribute to an app's overall success.

Business Objective :
The objective is to analyze user preferences and behaviors related to apps based on various attributes such as category, genre, number of installations, app size, and type (free or paid). These insights will assist developers in making informed decisions and tailoring their apps to align with user demands, ultimately enhancing app success and engagement.
